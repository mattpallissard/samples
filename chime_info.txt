Coding and Design - Whiteboarding Guidance: I have provided a LiveCode link for
the coding session of the interview. This system will allow you to code
collaboratively with your interviewer. Here’s how to launch LiveCode in your
interview: 1. Click on this link to start your session:
https://livecode.amazon.jobs/session/3f4951a5-9d61-484f-9c16-ddce04fd1ff5 2.
Enter your name (Note: The whiteboard will be locked until your interviewer
opens the session)

For your design session, we have approved the following guidance:

  *   Use a pen and paper to share designs with the interviewer through your
  *   video camera; or Use your favorite whiteboarding app and share screen in
  *   Chime; or If needed, we suggest using a free whiteboard web-based product
  *   such as https://awwapp.com, and share the screen through Chime.

Note: Please test any whiteboard product (and Chime) prior to the scheduled
interview to make sure there is proper understanding of how it functions.
